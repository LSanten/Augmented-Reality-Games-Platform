# QUESTIONS FOR THE TEACHING TEAM
 - Is it better to give all the functions of the model their respective arguments? Or is it okay to just let them take it from the model?
 - Is it useful to have the different View file and do we put all the other view classes in there? Or do we delete the view file?

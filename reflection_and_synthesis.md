## Feedback and decisions
_“ Based upon your notes from the technical review, synthesize the feedback you received addressing your key questions. How do you plan to incorporate it going forward? What new questions did you generate?”_<br/><br/>
- A lot of people gave the input that we should make sure to be careful about not making the project too complicated for ourselves. So they suggested keeping our complete system as simple as possible
- Voice recognition leans to the above, it was too big of an extra thing to work on with no more value regarding the focus of the project (AR)
- Possibly make interactions between files and classes using lists.
- Concerning the live background camera feed, we got a lot of input from the audience. Most people liked it so we are probably not going to change it. We are thinking about having settings to change the background to black and just show the players’ faces and their controllers.
- Another fun function suggested was to allow the user to record the screen and their facial expressions as a video
- The idea of using voice-recognition was not popular at all and we also did not get any other feedback for other use of it. Mostly because it would take a lot of our time and would not add a lot of value to our arcade.
- On the database, we got an interesting idea of saving the high scores in a file which we would then push to the repository. We looked into this but it seems not very feasible.
- On the appearance side of the program, we got some cool ideas to make our GUI more attractive.
- We got a lot of feedback and ideas on how to efficiently work together with three people. Divide and conquer seemed to be the common reaction, with a focus on dividing the games/parts of the main code, with meeting times used to update and get cross-help and tie the chunks together. An extra possibility is working with 2 persons on one of the parts using pair-programming or Teletype.

## Review process reflection
“How did the review go? Did you get answers to your key questions? Did you provide too much/too little context for your audience? Did you stick closely to your planned agenda, or did you discover new things during the discussion that made you change your plans? What could you do next time to have an even more effective technical review?”<br/>

We feel like we did a decent job on our presentation. We got some useful feedback and we felt that people understood our project and were pretty enthusiastic about it in general. A problem we maybe had, was that we had too much deeper questions about our code. This is partly because we started from an existing project and already decided on a general direction to go. <br/>

During the preparation, we came up with many very technical code questions. We decided to not ask them during the presentation since it did not seem appropriate regarding the level of experience of the audience. We could not come up with a good solution for this issue.<br/>

We could have used the presentation for a deeper interaction with the audience. For instance, a 1 or 2-minute post-it ideation session or a collective brainstorm on the whiteboard would have generated more creative and interesting ideas and possible working directions.
